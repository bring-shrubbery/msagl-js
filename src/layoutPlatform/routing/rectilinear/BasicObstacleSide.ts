//  BasicObstacleSide is base class for an obstacle side that is to the low or high end of the
//  scanline-parallel coordinate, and knows which direction to traverse to find the endVertex.
//  This is different from RightObstacleSide or LeftObstacleSide, where the class itself is the
//  determinant of traversal direction being with or opposite to the clockwise polyline direction;
