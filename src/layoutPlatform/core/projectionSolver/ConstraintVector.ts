  //  This is the list of lists of unsatisfiable constraints accumulated during all Block.Expand calls.

  //  where both variables are already connected by an active tree, so therefore they must already be in the
  //  same block; therefore the cycle can't be created by MergeBlocks.  If there is a forward non-equality
  //  constraint in the path, then that constraint will be deactivated and its variables moved, so there is
  //  no cycle.  So the only condition for a cycle is that Expand finds no forward non-equality constraint.
  /// /
  //  Equality constraints (forward or backward) returned in the path between the .left and .right variables
  //  of the constraint passed to Expand() do not change this; if you have an unsatisfied inequality constraint
  //  between the two variables of an equality constraint, then the inequality is unsatisfiable; and by extension
  //  then if it is between two variables between which there exists a path consisting solely of equality
  //  constraints and backward-inequality constraints, it is unsatisfiable.
  /// /
  //  Negative gaps mean "left can be up to <+gap> greater than right", so again this does not affect it.
  /// /
  //  Therefore the only reason multi-constraint cycles would exist is if a block was expanded to accommodate
  //  the constraint (incrementing the offsets to the right) despite not having found a forward minLagrangian.
