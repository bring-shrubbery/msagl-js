//  A Variable is essentially a wrapper around a node, containing the node's initial and
//  current (Actual) positions along the current axis and a collection of Constraints.

export class Variable {
  //  Passed through as a convenience to the caller; it is not used by ProjectionSolver directly
  //  (except in VERIFY/VERBOSE where it uses ToString()), but if the variable list returned by
  //  Solver.Variables is sorted, then UserData must implement IComparable.  When Solve() is
  //  complete, the caller should copy the Variable's ActualPos property into whatever property
  //  the class specialization for this has.

  UserData: any

  //  These properties are initialized by caller before being passed to Solver.AddVariable.

  //  This holds the desired position of the node (the position we'd like it to have, initially
  //  calculated before any constraint application).  This may change during the process of
  //  solution; currently that only happens if there are neighbors.  Each iteration of the
  //  solution keeps block reference-position calculation as close as possible to this position.

  DesiredPos: number

  //  Variable has no Size member.  We use only the DesiredPos and (Scaled)ActualPos and
  //  assume only a point (in a single dimension).  OverlapRemoval takes care of generating
  //  constraints using size information.  It would not make sense to incorporate Size into
  //  the violation calculation at the ProjectionSolver level for two reasons:
  //    - It would not take into account the potential deferral from horizontal to vertical
  //      when the vertical movement could be much less.
  //    - It would not automatically ensure that all overlap constraints were even calculated;
  //      it would only enforce constraints added by the caller, which would either use
  //      OverlapRemoval or have constraint-generation logic optimized for its own scenario.

  //  The weight of the node; a variable with a higher weight than others in its block will
  //  move less than it would if all weights were equal.

  Weight: number

  //  The scale of the variable.  May be set by the application.  For Qpsc this is computed
  //  from the Hessian diagonal and replaces any application-set value during Solve().

  Scale: number

  //  The current position of the variable; s[i]y[i] in the scaling paper.  It is updated on each
  //  iteration inside Solve(), then unscaled to contain the final position when Solve() completes.

  ActualPos: number

  //  The derivative value - essentially the weighted difference in position.

  public get DfDv(): number {
    return (2 * (this.Weight * (this.ActualPos - this.DesiredPos))) / this.Scale
  }

  //  Updated through Solve().
  OffsetInBlock: number

  Block: Block

  //  For Qpsc
  Ordinal: number
  //  Use an array[] for Constraints for performance.  Their membership in the Variable doesn't change after
  //  Solve() initializes, so we can use the fixed-size array and gain performance (at some up-front cost due
  //  to buffering in AddVariable/AddConstraint, but the tradeoff is a great improvement).  This cannot be done
  //  for Variables (whose membership in a Block changes) or Blocks (whose membership in the block list changes).
  //  Constraints where 'this' is constraint.Left
  LeftConstraints: Constraint[]

  //  Constraints where 'this' is constraint.Right
  RightConstraints: Constraint[]

  Neighbors: Array<NeighborAndWeight>
